  <h1>Aviation Basics: Simple Preflight Overview</h1>

  <p>
    A preflight inspection is a set of checks a pilot does before flying an airplane. It helps make sure the aircraft is safe and ready for the trip. Pilots look for obvious damage, missing parts, or anything that seems unusual. Even the shortest flights start with a thorough preflight.
  </p>

  <p>
    Some of these checks include inspecting at the airplane’s exterior and reviewing important information for the flight. A pilot will usually check fuel, oil, tires, control surfaces, and lights. Inside the cockpit, they confirm instruments are functioning and documents are present. Doing these steps can prevent small problems from becoming serious in the air.
